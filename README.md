# Create Insert Update Delete - SQL and Python
## Work to do:
- First, carefully examine this [Google File:](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-FcIeVUaRaEDmt5pGsDfiye6bfrdFk9tkUn-7HXRBI0/edit?usp=sharing) 

- Annotate next to each program what happens with each code block.
- Highlight the parts of code that are similar to each other. 
- Download the code from github and run each one. 

- After running the code for creating a table, you should then create a table for teachers. 

**Challenge:**
Find a way to add a teacherID to a student record (e.g. You could add one teacher to a student - maybe their PC teacher. Hint: you will need to alter the student table to hold this field!) 

**Bonus:**
Make this a text input so that the user can:
- select student and save this to a variable
- select a teacher and save this to a variable
- update the student to add the teacherID to the new field (hint: you'll need to look at some of the insert files from the other day to help.... ?, ? )
